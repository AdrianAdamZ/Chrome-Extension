# Chrome-Extension
Hack-a-thon Chrome Extension


create interface for our extension, there should be a popup - when we click our extension- have a button to change grab highlighted text


add button to complete selection and turn into highlight



when we highlight text, change it to the color that was selected

********************************************************

We created "content scripts" to be able to make changes to the DOM

Used a template element which serves as a wrapper for selected text on a webpage, this allows us to render the selected text into highlighted text during runtime and to display a button to mark the selection
